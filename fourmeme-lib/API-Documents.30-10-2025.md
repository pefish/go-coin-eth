# CHANGES - 19/09/2024

## TokenManager(V1) & TokenManager2(V2)

- These smart contracts are designed for creating new tokens and executing trades.
- The old TokenManager (referred to as V1) still functions for trading tokens that have already been created but cannot create new tokens; It is only used to support the buying and selling of tokens created before the TokenManager2 (referred to as V2) deployment.
- If full support four.meme is needed, both TokenManager V1 and V2 should be supported.
- If you only wish to support tokens created after September 5, 2024, then only V2 TokenManager needs to be supported.
- The method for simultaneously supporting both V1 and V2 TokenManagers is as follows:
    - First, use the TokenManagerHelper method getTokenInfo to get the token information.
    - Check information if the token was created by V1 that the tradings should be processed through the interfaces of old V1 TokenManager. Otherwise, use the V2 version.
    - If pre-calculations of trading are needed, call helper methods.

## TokenManagerHelper3 (V3)

- This smart contract is a wrapper of the TokenManagers. It is designed for getting token information and performing pre-calculations easily.
- The old TokenManagerHelper (referred to as V1/V2) still works but we have provided a new TokenManagerHelper3 (referred to as V3) contract that unifies the information query interfaces for both V1 TokenManager and V3 TokenManager.
- We recommend users who have previously used V1/V2 helper to migrate to V3 helper. it supports tokens created by both TokenManager V1 and V2.
  

# Protocol Interfaces

# FAQ

## Error Codes

### buyToken Errors

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| GW - GWEI | Amount precision is not aligned to GWEI |
| ZA - Zero Address | The 'to' address should not be set to address(0) |
| TO - Invalid to | The 'to' address should not be set to PancakePair address |
| Slippage | The amount spent for purchase exceeds maxFunds |
| More BNB | Insufficient BNB sent in msg.value for purchase |
| A | Buy X Mode exclusive token by error method. Please use the X Mode buy method.

### sellToken Errors

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| GW - GWEI | Amount precision is not aligned to GWEI |
| FR - FeeRate | Fee rate exceeds 5% |
| SO - Small Order | Order amount is too small |
| Slippage | Amount of tokens received from sale is less than minAmount |




## How to Identify X Mode Exclusive Tokens

There are two ways to determine whether a token is **exclusive** (X Mode):

### 1. Off-chain

Query token info via https://four.meme/meme-api/v1/private/token/get?address=[token address] or https://four.meme/meme-api/v1/private/token/getById?id=[parameter `requestId` from the TokenCreate event]
#### Check the `version` value returned from the token information API. If `version = V8`, the token is an **exclusive token**.

### 2. On-chain

Retrieve the value:

```solidity
template = TokenManager2._tokenInfos[tokenAddress].template;
```

Then check:

```solidity
if (template & 0x10000 > 0) {
    // The token is exclusive
}
```

If the condition above is true, the token is an **exclusive token**.

---

### Interface Reference

```solidity

    struct TokenInfo {
